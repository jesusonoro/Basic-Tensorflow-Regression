# Basic-Tensorflow-Regression

The problem to solve is to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, where the approximate formula is:
𝑓=𝑐×1.8+32 

I give TensorFlow some sample Celsius values (0, 8, 15, 22, 38, 60, 80) and their corresponding Fahrenheit values (32, 46, 59, 72, 100, 140, 176). Then, this data is used to train a ML model that figures out the above formula through the training process.
